The closest beach for swimming is Calshot Beach, on the edge of New Forest National Park.

The beach is a 30-40-minute drive from central Southampton or an hour-long journey by bus from Southampton Central rail station. A little further south-west down the coast is the beach at Lepe Country Park, a mile-long stretch offering some sand and some stones. It's ideal for swimming and opular with kite surfers and windsurfers, also offering views out to the Isle of Wight on a clear day. Lepe Country Park is located 30-40 minutes away from Southampton by car. For something a little closer, Western Shore is less than three miles from Southampton city centre. Although not recommended for swimming, Weston Shore has a wide footpath that makes it great for biking and strolling, and the grassy lawn is lovely for picnics. For a classic British seaside resort experience, Bournemouth is a popular escape for Southampton residents, reached via a 35-minute train from Southampton Central or a 45-minute drive on the motorway."
